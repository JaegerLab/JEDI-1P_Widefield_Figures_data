# JEDI-1P_Widefiled_Figures_data_scripts
This repository contains data and scripts used to generate figures (Fig 3-6, Supplementary Fig 8-12) related to in vivo widefield imaging in manuscript: detecting rapid pan-cortical voltage dynamics in vivo under widefield one-photon imaging with a brighter and faster voltage indicator. 

## Dependencies: 
Scritps were tested on MATLAB 2020b and MATLAB 2022b. Note that 'viridis' colormap might not be availble for later versions.
